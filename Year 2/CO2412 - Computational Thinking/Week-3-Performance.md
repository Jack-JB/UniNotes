# Performance & Efficiency

## Formal Verification

**Verification:** Proof that the developed product complies with its specification.

- Where possible, provide a rigorous logical/mathematical proof; otherwise, provide documentation discussing agreed standards/procedures

**Validation:** Empirical evaluation to what extent the user requirements are met.

- All requirements need to be covered and demonstrated at least once
- Ideally, **requirements** are not identical with the specification. They should be user-oriented; e.g., epics and user stories in a requirement analysis from agile software engineering. **Feedback from users** is needed

**Testing:** Use-case driven evaluation of the final (or alpha, or beta) product.

- The considered **use cases** should be **representative**
- They should be as unrelated as possible to any concrete scenarios considered during development, including the validation process
- Ideally, **conducted by prospective users;** otherwise, "play the user"

> **Verification** always has the meaning that something is demonstrated to be true, particularly by logical reasoning. **Validation** and **testing** have many meanings to different communities; the distinction here is common in AI (e.g., validation set vs. test set).
