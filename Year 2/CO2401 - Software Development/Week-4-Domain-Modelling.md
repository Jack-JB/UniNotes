# Domain Modelling

## Conceptual Model

- Purpose is to capture all relevant information about the system domain provided in the requirements document

- - Model forms basis for the structure of the system

- Identifies relevant entities from the requirements domain and their â€¦

- - Attributes

  - Associations

  - - Including aggregation and composition

  - Multiplicities

  - invariants

## Points to remember

- This is not an exact science

- - Different development team may produce different conceptual models of the system domain
  - May have different classes, depend on how specific requirements document is.

- Even if the same classes, associations etc. are identified there are different ways of representing them in a UML class diagram

- - e.g. class properties could be noted as an attribute

## Multiplicities

- The requirements may specify the number of individual links between specific objects
- If important, we can show multiplicities on a class diagram
