# Design

> "All aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and it's products" ~ Jakob Neilsen and Don Norman (2014)

## HCI Approach

- HCI focuses on design, evaluation, implementation of interactive systems for humans
- Interdisciplinary (psychology, design, engineering, art, history, archaeology, sociology etc.)
- HCI is an applied field
- HCI teaches us to design for many and not for ourselves
- Design is expensive and difficult
- Lack of understanding users lead to products becoming impossible to use

## Wireframing

Once you understand the user and business requirements of what you are building and before you start any further work. You should create a wireframe of the product you envision.

> A wireframe should:
>
> - Outline the bare bone structure and hierarchy of an application
> - Inform how navigation will take place
> - Be realistic, feasible within what you are envisioning
> - Be consistent
> - Focus on functionality
> - Focus on accessibility
> - Divide a complex application down into smaller components
> - Include annotations to help others understand

Wireframing should be an iterative process. User feedback should be incorporated into the next iteration of the wireframe. Each iteration is a learning process and an improvement to the build.

Feedback is crucial at this stage, increasing the chance of building a better product. Failing and learning at this stage is cost effective due to the low-fidelity nature. Failing during programming is expensive.

## Evaluation Heuristics

- Usability inspection method

- Experts use a set of usability principles to guide them in identifying problems during use of the system.

  > Experts identify:
  >
  > - Which heuristic was violated
  > - Where in the program
  > - What they were doing
  > - The severity

## Nielsen's 10 Heuristics

> 1. Visibility of System Status
> 2. Match between System & Real World
> 3. User Control and Freedom
> 4. Consistency and Standards
> 5. Error Prevention
> 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
> 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
> 8. Aesthetic and Minimalistic Design
> 9. Help Users With Errors
> 10. Help and Documentation

## General Heuristics

> - Every pixel counts (clarity/content)
> - Every round trip counts (data transmission)
> - Core features (frequently used)
> - Keep navigation simple
> - Minimise data entry
> - Store important data reliably and securely

## User Interface Design Principals

Interacting with technology comes down to two challenges users must overcome;

1. Understanding: learning
2. Execution: taking action

Normal (The Design of Everyday Things, Norman 1988) refers to these as the gulf of evaluation and the gulf of execution. This is because in order to break down these challenges, there must be effective design elements.

## Gulf Example

- Your **goal** is to post a message on Facebook, your **end result** is the post being visible on Facebook (News Feed).
- The gulf of execution: typing a message out, clicking on 'post'. The gulf is small when you have fewer obstacles on your way, and larger when you have to confirm/choose additional options etc.
- The gulf of evaluation: is when a user is waiting for feedback from a system, and the system does not provide the feedback or, it does not provide the feedback that the user is waiting for. Did my post appear on my News Feed?

## Norman's Six Principals

We can avoid these gulfs through Don Norman's 'Six Principals'.

> 1. Visibility - can you see it?
> 2. Feedback - is it done?
> 3. Constraints - why won't it let me do it?
> 4. Mapping - where am I and where do I need to go?
> 5. Consistency - does it look the same throughout?
> 6. Affordance - how do I use it?

## Interaction Modalities

Computing devices utilise a wide range of modalities to communicate with us.

- Visual - GUI typically through the screen
- Audible - Audio bleeps/chimes
- Tactile - Vibrations or other movements

There are other modalities such as gustation, olfaction, thermoception, nocieption, equilibrioception
