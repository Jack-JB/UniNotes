# Pointers

- Pointers do not store values directly
- Pointers point at other variables
- pointer stores a memory location (address)
- Pointers are given a datatype. However, this is the type they point at. The pointers themselves are identical
- All pointers are the same size

## Why use pointers?

- Pointers are fast, the CPU is designed to process numbers and memory addresses. The use of addresses is efficient
- Pointers can point at large, complex data structures such as classes or structs. It is far faster to deal with the dress than the data
- Pointer manipulation is efficient and easy.
- Pointers allow access to the full functionality of classes, e.g. polymorphism
- Pointers allow access to memory management
