# Stacks

## Stack Operations

- **Push** means put an item of data on the top of the stack

- **Pop** means remove an item of data from the top of the stack.

- Every time a new element is **pushed** on to the stack the value which stores the location of the top of the stack increased by 1

- Every time an old element is **popped** on to the stack the value which stores the location of the stop of the stack is decresed by one
